You can press `cmd + a` to skip to the beggining of the line in Nano and `cmd + e` to 
skip to the end of the line.

You can make a new line in Github readme.md files by using **two trailing spaces** at the 
end of a line and then pressing **enter**. This will create a new line without creating a 
new paragraph.  
`"your line of text" 'space' 'space' 'enter'`

                               --
You can place images in a readme.md file for GitHub. To do so, you need to use the Markdown 
syntax and include the image's URL or link. For example, you can use the following syntax: 

<pre><code>![my profile](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69256174?v=4)</pre></code>
  
that will do the following:

![my profile](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69256174?v=4)
