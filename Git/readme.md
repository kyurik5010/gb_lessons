you can place images in a readme.md file for GitHub.  
To do so, you need to use the Markdown syntax and  
include the image's URL or link.  
For example, you can use the following syntax: 

"![alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)"  

that will do the following:

![alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
