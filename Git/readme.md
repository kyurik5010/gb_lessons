Notes
-----

You can press ''cmd'+'a'' to skip to the beggining of the line in Nano and ''cmd'+'e'' to 
skip 
tp the end of the line.

You can make a new line in Github readme.md files by using two trailing spaces at the end of 
a line and then pressing enter. This will create a new line without creating a new 
paragraph.  
<pre><code>"your line of text" 'space' 'space' 'enter'</pre></code>

To create comments in Markdown You can use a combination of HTML 
comment tags and Markdown syntax, such as:

`[//]: # (Comment)`

You can also use a special comment syntax specific to Markdown parsers like GitHub Flavored 
Markdown (GFM):

`<!-- GFM-TASK: Comment -->`

You can place images in a readme.md file for GitHub.  
To do so, you need to use the Markdown syntax and  
include the image's URL or link.  
For example, you can use the following syntax: 

<pre><code>![alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)</pre></code>
  
that will do the following:

![alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
